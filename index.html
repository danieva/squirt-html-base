Plutarch’s “Life of Alexander”
Translated by J. Dryden
It being my purpose to write the lives of Alexander
the king, and of Caesar, by whom Pompey was
destroyed, the multitude of their great actions affords
so large a field that I were to blame if I should not by
way of apology forewarn my reader that I have
chosen rather to epitomize the most celebrated parts
of their story, than to insist at large on every particular
circumstance of it. It must be borne in mind that my
design is not to write histories, but lives. And the
most glorious exploits do not always furnish us with
the clearest discoveries of virtue or vice in men;
sometimes a matter of less moment, an expression or
a jest, informs us better of their characters and
inclinations, than the most famous sieges, the greatest
armaments, or the bloodiest battles whatsoever. Therefore as portrait-painters are more exact in
the lines and features of the face, in which the character is seen, than in the other parts of the
body, so I must be allowed to give my more particular attention to the marks and indications of
the souls of men, and while I endeavor by these to portray their lives, may be free to leave more
weighty matters and great battles to be treated of by others.
…
From hence designing to march against Darius, before he set out he diverted himself with his
officers at an entertainment of drinking and other pastimes, and indulged so far as to let every
one's mistress sit by and drink with them. The most celebrated of them was Thais, an Athenian,
mistress of Ptolemy, who was afterwards King of Egypt. She, partly as a sort of well-turned
compliment to Alexander, partly out of sport, as the drinking went on, at last was carried so far
as to utter a saying, not misbecoming her native country's character, though somewhat too lofty
for her own condition. She said it was indeed some recompense for the toils she had undergone
in following the camp all over Asia that she was that day treated in, and could insult over, the
stately palace of the Persian monarchs. But, she added, it would please her much better if, while
the king looked on, she might in sport, with her own hands, set fire to the court of that Xerxes
who reduced the city of Athens to ashes, that it might be recorded to posterity that the women
who followed Alexander had taken a severer revenge on the Persians for the suffering, and
affronts of Greece, than all the famed commanders had been able to do by sea or land. What she
said was received with such universal liking and murmurs of applause, and so seconded by the
encouragement and eagerness of the company, that the king himself, persuaded to be of the
party, started from his seat, and with a chaplet of flowers on his head and a lighted torch in his
hand, led them the way, while they went after him in a riotous manner, dancing and making loud
cries about the place; which when the rest of the Macedonians perceived, they also in great
delight ran thither with torches; for they hoped the burning and destruction of the royal palace
was an argument that he looked homeward, and had no design to reside among the barbarians. 2
Thus some writers give their account of this action, while others say it was done deliberately;
however, all agree that he soon repented of it, and gave order to put out the fire.
Alexander was naturally most munificent, and grew more so as his fortune increased,
accompanying what he gave with that courtesy and freedom which, to speak truth, is necessary
to make a benefit really obliging. I will give a few instances of this kind. Ariston, the captain of
the Paeonians, having killed an enemy, brought his head to show him, and told him that in his
country such a present was recompensed with a cup of gold. "With an empty one," said
Alexander, smiling, "but I drink to you in this, which I give you full of wine." Another time, as
one of the common soldiers was driving a mule laden with some of the king's treasure, the beast
grew tired, and the soldier took it upon his own back, and began to march with it, till Alexander
seeing the man so overcharged asked what was the matter; and when he was informed, just as he
was ready to lay down his burden for weariness, "Do not faint now," said he to him, "but finish
the journey, and carry what you have there to your own tent for yourself." He was always more
displeased with those who would not accept of what he gave than with those who begged of him.
And therefore he wrote to Phocion, that he would not own him for his friend any longer if he
refused his presents. He had never given anything to Serapion, one of the youths that played at
ball with him, because he did not ask of him, till one day, it coming to Serapion's turn to play, he
still threw the ball to others, and when the king asked him why he did not direct it to him,
"Because you do not ask for it," said he; which answer pleased him so that he was very liberal to
him afterwards. One Proteas, a pleasant, jesting, drinking fellow, having incurred his displeasure,
got his friends to intercede for him, and begged his pardon himself with tears, which at last
prevailed, and Alexander declared he was friends with him. "I cannot believe it," said Proteas,
"unless you first give me some pledge of it." The king understood his meaning, and presently
ordered five talents to be given him. How magnificent he was in enriching his friends, and those
who attended on his person, appears by a letter which Olympias wrote to him, where she tells
him he should reward and honor those about him in a more moderate way. "For now," said she,
"you make them all equal to kings, you give them power and opportunity of making many
friends of their own, and in the meantime you leave yourself destitute." She often wrote to him to
this purpose, and he never communicated her letters to anybody, unless it were one which he
opened when Hephaestion was by, whom he permitted, as his custom was, to read it along with
him; but then as soon as he had done, he took off his ring, and set the seal upon Hephaestion's
lips. Mazaeus, who was the most considerable man in Darius's court, had a son who was already
governor of a province. Alexander bestowed another upon him that was better; he, however,
modestly refused, and told him, instead of one Darius, he went the way to make many
Alexanders. To Parmenio he gave Bagoas' house, in which he found a wardrobe of apparel worth
more than a thousand talents. He wrote to Antipater, commanding him to keep a life-guard about
him for the security of his person against conspiracies. To his mother he sent many presents, but
would never suffer her to meddle with matters of state or war, not indulging her busy temper,
and when she fell out with him on this account, he bore her ill-humor very patiently. Nay more,
when he read a long letter from Antipater full of accusations against her, "Antipater," he said,
"does not know that one tear of a mother effaces a thousand such letters as these."
But when he perceived his favorites grow so luxurious and extravagant in their way of living and
expenses that Hagnon, the Teian, wore silver nails in his shoes, that Leonnatus employed several
camels only to bring him powder out of Egypt to use when he wrestled, and that Philotas had 3
hunting nets a hundred furlongs in length, that more used precious ointment than plain oil when
they went to bathe, and that they carried about servants everywhere with them to rub them and
wait upon them in their chambers, he reproved them in gentle and reasonable terms, telling them
he wondered that they who had been engaged in so many single battles did not know by
experience, that those who labor sleep more sweetly and soundly than those who are labored for,
and could fail to see by comparing the Persians' manner of living with their own that it was the
most abject and slavish condition to be voluptuous, but the most noble and royal to undergo pain
and labor. He argued with them further, how it was possible for any one who pretended to be a
soldier, either to look well after his horse, or to keep his amour bright and in good order, who
thought it much to let his hands be serviceable to what was nearest to him, his own body. "Are
you still to learn," said he, "that the end and perfection of our victories is to avoid the vices and
infirmities of those whom we subdue? And to strengthen his precepts by example, he applied
himself now more vigorously than ever to hunting and warlike expeditions, embracing all
opportunities of hardship and danger, insomuch that a Lacedaemonian, who was there on an
embassy to him and chanced to be by when he encountered with and mastered a huge lion, told
him he had fought gallantly with the beast, which of the two should be king. Craterus caused a
representation to be made of this adventure, consisting of the lion and the dogs, of the king
engaged with the lion, and himself coming in to his assistance, all expressed in figures of brass,
some of which were by Lysippus, and the rest by Leochares; and had it dedicated in the temple
of Apollo at Delphi. Alexander exposed his person to danger in this manner, with the object both
of inuring himself and inciting others to the performance of brave and virtuous actions.
But his followers, who were grown rich, and consequently proud, longed to indulge themselves
in pleasure and idleness, and were weary of marches and expeditions, and at last went on so far
as to censure and speak ill of him. All which at first he bore very patiently, saying it became a
king well to do good to others, and be evil spoken of. Meantime, on the smallest occasions that
called for a show of kindness to his friends, there was every indication on his part of tenderness
and respect. Hearing Peucestes was bitten by a bear, he wrote to him that he took it unkindly he
should send others notice of it and not make him acquainted with it; "But now," said he, "since it
is so, let me know how you do, and whether any of your companions forsook you when you were
in danger, that I may punish them." He sent Hephaestion, who was absent about some business,
word how, while they were fighting for their diversion with an ichneumon, Craterus was by
chance run through both thighs with Perdiccas' javelin. And upon Peucestes' recovery from a fit
of sickness, he sent a letter of thanks to his physician Alexippus. When Craterus was ill, he saw a
vision in his sleep, after which he offered sacrifices for his health, and bade him do so likewise.
He wrote also to Pausanias, the physician, who was about to purge Craterus with hellebore,
partly out of an anxious concern for him, and partly to give him a caution how he used that
medicine. He was so tender of his friends' reputation that he imprisoned Ephialtes and Cissus,
who brought him the first news of Harpalus' flight and withdrawal from his service, as if they
had falsely accused him. When he sent the old and infirm soldiers home, Eurylochus, a citizen of
Aegae, got his name enrolled among the sick, though he ailed nothing, which being discovered,
he confessed he was in love with a young woman named Telesippa, and wanted to go along with
her to the sea-side. Alexander inquired to whom the woman belonged, and being told she was a
free courtesan, "I will assist you," said he to Eurylochus, "in your amour if your mistress be to be
gained either by presents or persuasions; but we must use no other means, because she is freeborn."
4
It is surprising to consider upon what slight occasions he would write letters to serve his friends.
As when he wrote one in which he gave order to search for a youth that belonged to Seleucus,
who was run away into Cilicia; and in another thanked and commanded Peucestes for
apprehending Nicon, a servant of Craterus; and in one to Megabyzus, concerning a slave that had
taken sanctuary in a temple, gave direction that he should not meddle with him while he was
there, but if he could entice him out by fair means, then he gave him leave to seize him. It is
reported of him that when he first sat in judgment upon capital causes he would lay his hand
upon one of his ears while the accuser spoke, to keep it free and unprejudiced in behalf of the
party accused. But afterwards such a multitude of accusations were brought before him, and so
many proved true, that he lost his tenderness of heart, and gave credit to those also that were
false; and especially when anybody spoke ill of him, he would be transported out of his reason,
and show himself cruel and inexorable, valuing his glory and reputation beyond his life or
kingdom.
But it signifies little to Alexander whether this be credited or no. Certain it is, that apprehending
the Macedonians would be weary of pursuing the war, he left the greater part of them in their
quarters; and having with him in Hyrcania the choice of his men only, amounting to twenty
thousand foot and three thousand horse, he spoke to them to this effect: That hitherto the
barbarians had seen them no otherwise than as it were in a dream, and if they should think of
returning when they had only alarmed Asia, and not conquered it, their enemies would set upon
them as upon so many women. However he told them he would keep none of them with him
against their will, they might go if they pleased; he should merely enter his protest, that when on
his way to make the Macedonians the masters of the world, he was left alone with a few friends
and volunteers. This is almost word for word as he wrote in a letter to Antipater, where he adds,
that when he had thus spoken to them, they all cried out, they would go along with him
whithersoever it was his pleasure to lead them. After succeeding with these, it was no hard
matter for him to bring over the multitude, which easily followed the example of their betters.
Now, also, he more and more accommodated himself in his way of living to that of the natives,
and tried to bring them also as near as he could to the Macedonian customs, wisely considering
that whilst he was engaged in an expedition which would carry him far from thence, it would be
wiser to depend upon the good-will which might arise from intermixture and association as a
means of maintaining tranquility, than upon force and compulsion. In order to this, he chose out
thirty thousand boys, whom he put under masters to teach them the Greek tongue, and to train
them up to arms in the Macedonian discipline. As for his marriage with Roxana, whose
youthfulness and beauty had charmed him at a drinking entertainment, where he first happened
to see her taking part in a dance, it was, indeed a love affair, yet it seemed at the same time to be
conducive to the object he had in hand. For it gratified the conquered people to see him choose a
wife from among themselves, and it made them feel the most lively affection for him, to find that
in the only passion which he, the most temperate of men, was overcome by, he yet forbore till he
could obtain her in a lawful and honorable way.
Noticing also that among his chief friends and favorites, Hephaestion most approved all that he
did, and complied with and imitated him in his change of habits, while Craterus continued strict
in the observation of the customs and fashions of his own country, he made it his practice to
employ the first in all transactions with the Persians, and the latter when he had to do with the
Greeks or Macedonians. And in general he showed more affection for Hephaestion, and more 5
respect for Craterus; Hephaestion, as he used to say, being Alexander's, and Craterus the king's
friend. And so these two friends always bore in secret a grudge to each other, and at times
quarreled openly, so much so that once in India they drew upon one another, and were
proceeding in good earnest, with their friends on each side to second them, when Alexander rode
up and publicly reproved Hephaestion, calling him fool and madman, not to be sensible that
without his favor he was nothing. He rebuked Craterus also in private, severely, and then causing
them both to come into his presence, he reconciled them, at the same time swearing by Ammon
and the rest of the gods. that he loved them two above all other men, but if ever he perceived
them fall out again he would be sure to put both of them to death, or at least the aggressor. After
which they neither ever did nor said anything, so much as in jest, to offend one another.
There was scarcely any one who had greater repute among the Macedonians than Philotas, the
son of Parmenio. For besides that he was valiant and able to endure any fatigue of war, he was
also next to Alexander himself the most munificent, and the greatest lover of his friends, one of
whom asking him for some money, he commanded his steward to give it him; and when he told
him he had not wherewith, "Have you not any plate, then," said he, "or any clothes of mine to
sell?" But he carried his arrogance and his pride of wealth and his habits of display and luxury to
a degree of assumption unbecoming a private man; and affecting all the loftiness without
succeeding in showing any of the grace or gentleness of true greatness, by this mistaken and
spurious majesty he gained so much envy and ill-will, that Parmenio would sometimes tell him,
"My son, to be not quite so great would be better." For he had long before been complained of,
and accused to Alexander. Particularly when Darius was defeated in Cilicia, and an immense
booty was taken at Damascus, among the rest of the prisoners who were brought into the camp,
there was one Antigone of Pydna, a very handsome woman, who fell to Philotas' share. The
young man one day in his cups, in the vaunting, outspoken, soldier's manner, declared to his
mistress, that all the great actions were performed by him and his father, the glory and benefit of
which, he said, together with the title of king, the boy Alexander reaped and enjoyed by their
means. She could not hold, but discovered what he had said to one of her acquaintance, and he,
as is usual in such cases, to another, till at last the story came to the ears of Craterus, who
brought the woman secretly to the king. When Alexander had heard what she had to say, he
commanded her to continue her intrigue with Philotas, and give him an account from time to
time of all that should fall from him to this purpose. He, thus unwittingly caught in a snare, to
gratify sometimes a fit of anger, sometimes a love of vainglory, let himself utter numerous
foolish, indiscreet speeches against the king in Antigone's hearing, of which, though Alexander
was informed and convinced by strong evidence, yet he would take no notice of it at present,
whether it was that he confided in Parmenio's affection and loyalty, or that he apprehended their
authority and interest in the army. But about this time, one Limnus, a Macedonian of Chalastra,
conspired against Alexander's life, and communicated his design to a youth whom he was fond
of, named Nicomachus, inviting him to be of the party. But he not relishing the thing, revealed it
to his brother Balinus, who immediately addressed himself to Philotas, requiring him to
introduce them both to Alexander, to whom they had something of great moment to impart
which very nearly concerned him. But he, for what reason is uncertain, went not with them,
professing that the king was engaged with affairs of more importance. And when they had urged
him a second time, and were still slighted by him, they applied themselves to another, by whose
means being admitted into Alexander's presence, they first told about Limnus' conspiracy, and by
the way let Philotas' negligence appear who had twice disregarded their application to him. 6
Alexander was greatly incensed, and upon finding that Limnus had defended himself, and had
been killed by the soldier who was sent to seize him, he was still more discomposed, thinking he
had thus lost the means of detecting the plot. As soon as his displeasure against Philotas began to
appear, presently all his old enemies showed themselves, and said openly, the king was too easily
imposed on, to imagine that one so inconsiderable as Limnus, a Chalastrian, should of his own
head undertake such an enterprise; that in all likelihood he was but subservient to the design, an
instrument that was moved by some greater spring; that those ought to be more strictly examined
about the matter whose interest it was so much to conceal it. When they had once gained the
king's ear for insinuations of this sort, they went on to show a thousand grounds of suspicion
against Philotas, till at last they prevailed to have him seized and put to the torture, which was
done in the presence of the principal officers, Alexander himself being placed behind some
tapestry to understand what passed. Where, when he heard in what a miserable tone, and with
what abject submissions Philotas applied himself to Hephaestion, he broke out, it is said, in this
manner: "Are you so mean-spirited and effeminate, Philotas, and yet can engage in so desperate
a design?" After his death, he presently sent into Media, and put also Parmenio, his father, to
death, who had done brave service under Philip, and was the only man of his older friends and
counselors who had encouraged Alexander to invade Asia. Of three sons whom he had had in the
army, he had already lost two, and now was himself put to death with the third. These actions
rendered Alexander an object of terror to many of his friends, and chiefly to Antipater, who, to
strengthen himself, sent messengers privately to treat for an alliance with the Aetolians, who
stood in fear of Alexander, because they had destroyed the town of the Oeniadae; on being
informed of which, Alexander had said the children of the Oeniadae need not revenge their
father's quarrel, for he would himself take care to punish the Aetolians.
...........................................................................................................................................................
When he came into Persia, he distributed money among the women, as their own kings had been
wont to do, who as often as they came thither gave every one of them a piece of gold; on account
of which custom, some of them, it is said, had come but seldom, and Ochus was so sordidly
covetous that, to avoid this expense, he never visited his native country once in all his reign.
Then finding Cyrus's sepulcher opened and rifled, he put Polymachus, who did it, to death,
though he was a man of some distinction, a born Macedonian of Pella. And after he had read the
inscription, he caused it to be cut again below the old one in Greek characters; the words being
these: "O man, whosoever thou art, and from whencesoever thou comest (for I know thou wilt
come), I am Cyrus, the founder of the Persian empire; do not grudge me this little earth which
covers my body." The reading of this sensibly touched Alexander, filling him with the thought of
the uncertainty and mutability of human affairs. At the same time Calanus, having been a little
while troubled with a disease in the bowels, requested that he might have a funeral pile erected,
to which he came on horseback, and, after he had said some prayers and sprinkled himself and
cut off some of his hair to throw into the fire, before he ascended it, he embraced and took leave
of the Macedonians who stood by, desiring them to pass that day in mirth and good-fellowship
with their king, whom in a little time, he said, he doubted not to see again at Babylon. Having
this said, he lay down, and covering up his face, he stirred not when the fire came near him, but
continued still in the same posture as at first, and so sacrificed himself, as it was the ancient
custom of the philosophers in those countries to do. The same thing was done long after by
another Indian who came with Caesar to Athens, where they still show you, "the Indian's 7
monument." At his return from the funeral pile, Alexander invited a great many of his friends
and principal officers to supper, and proposed a drinking match, in which the victor should
receive a crown. Promachus drank twelve quarts of wine, and won the prize, which was a talent
from them all; but he survived his victory but three days, and was followed, as Chares says, by
forty-one more, who died of the same debauch, some extremely cold weather having set in
shortly after.
At Susa, he married Darius's daughter Statira, and celebrated also the nuptials of his friends,
bestowing the noblest of the Persian ladies upon the worthiest of them, at the same time making
it an entertainment in honor of the other Macedonians whose marriages had already taken place.
At this magnificent festival, it is reported, there were no less than nine thousand guests, to each
of whom he gave a golden cup for the libations. Not to mention other instances of his wonderful
magnificence, he paid the debts of his army, which amounted to nine thousand eight hundred and
seventy talents. But Antigenes, who had lost one of his eyes, though he owed nothing, got his
name set down in the list of those who were in debt, and bringing one who pretended to be his
creditor, and to have supplied him from the bank, received the money. But when the cheat was
found out, the king was so incensed at it, that he banished him from court, and took away his
command, though he was an excellent soldier and a man of great courage. For when he was but a
youth, and served under Philip at the siege of Perinthus, where he was wounded in the eye by an
arrow shot out of an engine, he would neither let the arrow be taken out nor be persuaded to quit
the field till he had bravely repulsed the enemy and forced them to retire into the town.
Accordingly he was not able to support such a disgrace with any patience, and it was plain that
grief and despair would have made him kill himself, but the king fearing it, not only pardoned
him, but let him also enjoy the benefit of his deceit.
The thirty thousand boys whom he left behind him to be taught and disciplined were so improved
at his return, both in strength and beauty, and performed their exercises with such dexterity and
wonderful agility, that he was extremely pleased with them, which grieved the Macedonians. and
made them fear he would have the less value for them. And when he proceeded to send down the
infirm and maimed soldiers to the sea, they said they were unjustly and infamously dealt with,
after they were worn out in his service upon all occasions, now to be turned away with disgrace
and sent home into their country among their friends and relations in a worse condition than
when they came out; therefore they desired him to dismiss them one and all, and to account his
Macedonians useless, now he was so well furnished with a set of dancing boys, with whom, if he
pleased, he might go on and conquer the world. These speeches so incensed Alexander that, after
he had given them a great deal of reproachful language in his passion, he drove them away, and
committed the watch to Persians, out of whom he chose his guards and attendants. When the
Macedonians saw him escorted by these men, and themselves excluded and shamefully
disgraced, their high spirits fell, and conferring with one another, they found that jealousy and
rage had almost distracted them. But at last coming to themselves again, they went without their
arms, with only their under garments on, crying and weeping to offer themselves at his tent, and
desired him to deal with them as their baseness and ingratitude deserved. However, this would
not prevail; for though his anger was already something mollified, yet he would not admit them
into his presence, nor would they stir from thence, but continued two days and nights before his
tent, bewailing themselves, and imploring him as their lord to have compassion on them. But the
third day he came out to them, and seeing them very humble and penitent, he wept himself a 8
great while, after a gentle reproof spoke kindly to them, and dismissed those who were
unserviceable with magnificent rewards, and with his recommendation to Antipater, that when
they came home, at all public shows and in the theatres, they should sit on the best and foremost
seats, crowned with chaplets of flowers. He ordered, also, that the children of those who had lost
their lives in his service should have their father's pay continued to them.
When he came to Ecbatana in Media, and had dispatched his most urgent affairs, he began to
divert himself again with spectacles and public entertainments, to carry on which he had a supply
of three thousand actors and artists, newly arrived out of Greece. But they were soon interrupted
by Hephaestion's falling sick of a fever, in which, being a young man and a soldier, too, he could
not confine himself to so exact a diet as was necessary; for whilst his physician, Glaucus, was
gone to the theatre, he ate a fowl for his dinner, and drank a large draught of wine, upon which
he became very ill, and shortly after died. At this misfortune, Alexander was so beyond. all
reason transported that, to express his sorrow, he immediately ordered the manes and tails of all
his horses and mules to be cut, and threw down the battlements of the neighboring cities. The
poor physician he crucified, and forbade playing on the flute or any other musical instrument in
the camp a great while, till directions came from the oracle of Ammon, and enjoined him to
honor Hephaestion, and sacrifice to him as a hero. Then seeking to alleviate his grief in war, he
set out, as it were, to a hunt and chase of men, for he fell upon the Cossaeans, and put the whole
nation to the sword. This was called a sacrifice to Hephaestion's ghost. In his sepulcher and
monument and the adorning of them he intended to bestow ten thousand talents; and designing
that the excellence of the workmanship and the singularity of the design might outdo the
expense, his wishes turned, above all other artists, to Stasicrates, because he always promised
something very bold, unusual, and magnificent in his projects. Once when they had met before,
he had told him that, of all the mountains he knew, that of Athos in Thrace was the most capable
of being adapted to represent the shape and lineaments of a man; that if he pleased to command
him, he would make it the noblest and most durable statue in the world, which in its left hand
should hold a city of ten thousand inhabitants, and out of its right should pour a copious river
into the sea. Though Alexander declined this proposal, yet now he spent a great deal of time with
workmen to invent and contrive others even more extravagant and sumptuous.
As he was upon his way to Babylon, Nearchus, who had sailed back out of the ocean up the
mouth of the river Euphrates, came to tell him he had met with some Chaldaean diviners, who
had warned him against Alexander's going thither. Alexander, however, took no thought of it,
and went on, and when he came near the walls of the place, he saw a great many crows fighting
with one another, some of whom fell down just by him. After this, being privately informed that
Apollodorus, the governor of Babylon, had sacrificed, to know what would become of him, he
sent for Pythagoras, the soothsayer, and on his admitting the thing, asked him in what condition
he found the victim; and when he told him the liver was defective in its lobe, "A great presage
indeed!" said Alexander. However, he offered Pythagoras no injury, but was sorry that he had
neglected Nearchus' advice, and stayed for the most part outside the town, removing his tent
from place to place, and sailing up and down the Euphrates. Besides this, he was disturbed by
many other prodigies. A tame ass fell upon the biggest and handsomest lion that he kept, and
killed him by a kick. And one day after he had undressed himself to be anointed, and was playing
at ball, just as they were going to bring his clothes again, the young men who played with him
perceived a man clad in the king's robes with a diadem upon his head, sitting silently upon his 9
throne. They asked him who he was, to which he gave no answer a good while, till at last,
coming to himself, he told them his name was Dionysius that he was of Messenia, that for some
crime of which he was accused he was brought thither from the seaside, and had been kept long
in prison, that Serapis appeared to him, had freed him from his chains, conducted him to that
place, and commanded him to that place, and commanded him to put on the king's robe and
diadem, and to sit where they found him, and to say nothing. Alexander, when he heard this, by
the direction of his soothsayers, put the fellow to death, but he lost his spirits, and grew diffident
of the protection and assistance of the gods, and suspicious of his friends. His greatest
apprehension was of Antipater and his sons, one of whom, Iolaus, was his chief cupbearer; and
Cassander, who had lately arrived, and had been bred up in Greek manners, the first time he saw
some of the barbarians adore the king could not forbear laughing at it aloud, which so incensed
Alexander he took him by the hair with both hands and dashed his head against the wall. Another
time, Cassander would have said something in defense of Antipater to those who accused him,
but Alexander interrupting him, said, "What is it you say? Do you think people, if they had
received no injury, would make such a journey only to calumniate your father?" To which when
Cassander replied, that their coming so far from the evidence was a great proof of the falseness
of their charges, Alexander smiled, and said those were some of Aristotle's sophisms, which
would serve equally on both sides; and added, that both he and his father should be severely
punished, if they were found guilty of the least injustice towards those who complained. All
which made such a deep impression of terror in Cassander's mind that, long after, when he was
King of Macedonia and master of Greece, as he was walking up and down at Delphi, and looking
at the statues, at the sight of that of Alexander he was suddenly struck with alarm, and shook all
over, his eyes rolled, his head grew dizzy, and it was long before he recovered himself.
When once Alexander had given way to fears of supernatural influence, his mind grew so
disturbed and so easily alarmed that, if the least unusual or extraordinary thing happened, he
thought it a prodigy or a presage, and his court was thronged with diviners and priests whose
business was to sacrifice and purify and foretell the future. So miserable a thing is incredulity
and contempt of divine power on the one hand, and so miserable, also, superstition on the other,
which like water, where the level has been lowered, flowing in and never stopping, fills the mind
with slavish fears and follies, as now in Alexander's case. But upon some answers which were
brought him from the oracle concerning Hephaestion, he laid aside his sorrow, and fell again to
sacrificing and drinking; and having given Nearchus a splendid entertainment, after he had
bathed, as was his custom, just as he was going to bed, at Medius' request he went to supper with
him. Here he drank all the next day, and was attacked with a fever, which seized him, not as
some write, after he had drunk of the bowl of Hercules, nor was he taken with any sudden pain in
his back, as if he had been struck with a lance, for these are the inventions of some authors who
thought it their duty to make the last scene of so great an action as tragic and moving as they
could. Aristobulus tells us, that in the rage of his fever and a violent thirst, he took a draught of
wine, upon which he fell into delirium, and died on the thirtieth day of the month Daesius.
But the journals give the following record. On the eighteenth day of the month he slept in the
bathing-room on account of his fever. The next day he bathed and removed into his chamber, and
spent his time in playing at dice with Medius. In the evening he bathed and sacrificed, and ate
freely, and had the fever on him through the night. On the twentieth, after the usual sacrifices and
bathing, he lay in the bathing-room and heard Nearchus' narrative of his voyage, and the 10
observations he had made in the great sea. The twenty-first he passed in the same manner, his
fever still increasing, and suffered much during the night. The next day the fever was very
violent, and he had himself removed and his bed set by the great bath, and discoursed with his
principal officers about finding fit men to fill up the vacant places in the army. On the twentyfourth
he was much worse, and was carried out of his bed to assist at the sacrifices, and gave
order that the general officers should wait within the court, whilst the inferior officers kept watch
without doors. On the twenty-fifth he was removed to his palace on the other side the river,
where he slept a little, but his fever did not abate, and when the generals came into his chamber
he was speechless and continued so the following day. The Macedonians, therefore, supposing
he was dead, came with great clamors to the gates, and menaced his friends so that they were
forced to admit them, and let them all pass through unarmed by his bedside. The same day
Python and Seleucus were dispatched to the temple of Serapis to inquire if they should bring
Alexander thither, and were answered by the god that they should not remove him. On the
twenty-eighth, in the evening, he died. This account is most of it word for word as it is written in
the diary.
At the time, nobody had any suspicion of his being poisoned, but upon some information given
six years after, they say Olympias put many to death, and scattered the ashes of Iolaus, then
dead, as if he had given it him. But those who affirm that Aristotle counseled Antipater to do it,
and that by his means the poison was brought, adduced one Hagnothemis as their authority, who,
they say, heard King Antigonus speak of it, and tell us that the poison was water, deadly cold as
ice, distilled from a rock in the district of Nonacris, which they gathered like a thin dew, and kept
in an ass's hoof; for it was so very cold and penetrating that no other vessel would hold it.
However, most are of opinion that all this is a mere made-up story, no slight evidence of which
is, that during the dissensions among the commanders, which lasted several days, the body
continued clear and fresh, without any sign of such taint or corruption, though it lay neglected in
a close sultry place.
Roxana, who was now with child, and upon that account much honored by the Macedonians,
being jealous of Statira, sent for her by a counterfeit letter, as if Alexander had been still alive;
and when she had her in her power, killed her and her sister, and threw their bodies into a well,
which they filled up with earth, not without the privity and assistance of Perdiccas, who in the
time immediately following the king's death, under cover of the name of Arrhidaeus, whom he
carried about him as a sort of guard to his person, exercised the chief authority. Arrhidaeus, who
was Philip's son by an obscure woman of the name of Philinna, was himself of weak intellect,
not that he had been originally deficient either in body or mind, on the contrary, in his childhood,
he had showed a happy and promising character enough. But a diseased habit of body, caused by
drugs which Olympias gave him, had ruined, not only his health, but his understanding.
